Fix up any problems the graders found in your Lab 2 files.
Create a new text file named "Lab3_your-user-name.css". For example, I would name my file "Lab3_djskrien.css".
Fill in this new CSS file with valid CSS data to add layout to your resume.
You must use at least two columns somewhere in your resume using the float property to lay one or both of them out.
In addition, you must use at least one new CSS property from each of the following groups, as organized on w3schools.com:
background (not just background-color and background-image)
border and outline
dimension
margin
padding
pseudo-classes
As before, you are not allowed to add any style information to the HTML files. Instead, all such information must be in one of the CSS files.
You are welcome to continue to enhance/change the contents and non-layout styling of your resume in addition to adding layout styling to it.
Don't forget to add links to the new CSS file in your HTML files.
Finally, spruce up your resume by using two additional CSS properties that we did not discuss in class and that you haven't already used in Lab 2. Include in the header comment of your file a brief paragraph explaining which new properties you used.
Make sure that your resume looks well laid out even after the user resizes the window and/or zooms in or out.
So far we've been using only the Google Chrome browser to test your code. But we will test this lab using Firefox and Safari as well, so be sure your resume looks good in all three of these browsers.
As always, don't forget to test your web page against the HTML5 standard at http://validator.w3.org/ and fix any errors that the validator finds. Also, test your CSS file against the CSS standard at http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ and fix any errors.
