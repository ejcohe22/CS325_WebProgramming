Introduction
Not only is it important to have a well-organized resume, but your resume has to be attractive if you want to get a job, especially a job as a web programmer.

In this lab, you will take your resume from Lab 1 and add style to it through the use of a CSS file.

Details
Create a new file named "Lab2_your-user-name.css". For example, I would name my file "Lab2_djskrien.css".
To tie your CSS file with your HTML files, add the following line to the head section of the HTML files:
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="Lab1_your-user-name.css" />
Fill in your CSS file with valid CSS data to add style to your resume. The styling is up to you, subject to the following restrictions and subject to everyone's sense of classy styles.
You must use at least one CSS property from each of the following groups:
color, background-color
background-image
font, font-family, font-size, font-weight, font-style
text-align
text-indent, text-decoration, line-height, text-shadow
list-style, list-style-type
col, colgroup
You must use at least one selector from each of the following categories:
element
class
id
attribute
pseudo-class
Read about how styles can be used to change the appearance of tables and use at least one CSS property--other than col or colgroup--to add style to a table in your resume.
Do not use any layout materials discussed in Chapter 4 of our text. We will add layout styles later.
Note that you are not allowed to add any style information to the HTML files. Instead, all such information must be in the CSS file and the HTML files should link to the CSS file.
You are welcome to enhance the contents of your resume in addition to adding style to it.
If you wish to use more than one CSS file, that's fine.
Finally, use at least two styles other than the styles mentioned above and that we did not discuss in class, to spruce up your resume. To get full credit, you must include in the header comment of your CSS file a brief paragraph explaining which new styles you used and why you used them.
Don't forget to test your CSS file against the CSS standard at http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ and fix any errors.
