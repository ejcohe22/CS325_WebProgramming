Fill in this file and one or more auxiliary files with valid HTML to construct a resume for yourself, as if you were about to graduate and needed an online resume for job hunting.
Use appropriate HTML tags to make your resume look professional. You must use at least one tag from each of the following groups:
<h1>, <h2>,...
<hr />
<p>, <br />
<ol>, <ul>, <li>
<img>
<dl>, <dt>, <dd>
<em>, <strong>
<blockquote>, <q>
<code>
<pre>
<abbr>
<sup>, <sub>
<table>
<time>
<details>, <summary>
<header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>
<a> (include an external and an internal link)
It is possible that, in class, I don't cover all of the tags listed here. For any that I haven't covered, I want you to read about them in Chapter 2 or online and include them in your resume.
In addition, use at least two extra tags that are not in the list above to spruce up your resume. To get full credit, you must include in the header comment of your Lab1_your-user-name.html file a brief paragraph explaining which new tags you used and what you used them for.
Finally, make tooltip text appear over at least one element of your pages.
You are required to create at least two pages for your resume. Be sure that the pages are logically organized, for example, with a link from the main page to another page which contains more details about a specific topic (don't just break your resume in half and put half in each of two pages).
If you have led a dull life and so have nothing to put in your resume, you are allowed to make up things. If you do so, be sure and include a comment in your HTML file indicating which things were made up.
Don't create a CSS file nor add any <style> tags in your files. We'll stylize your resume in a later lab.
After everyone's pages have been submitted, I might like to show some of the resumes you created to the class to let others see the ideas some of you came up with. If you would prefer that I not show your pages to the class, please let me know by class time on Tuesday.
